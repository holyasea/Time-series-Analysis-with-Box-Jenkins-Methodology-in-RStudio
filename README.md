# Predicting Uganda Trade Data Using Time Series Models
This script was initially written for a my final year research project. The aim was to evaluate various time series models inorder to predict Trade figures for Uganda.
## Title: TIME SERIES ANALYSIS OF THE MONTHLY VALUE OF IMPORTS AND EXPORTS FOR UGANDA (1997 â€“ 2017)
### OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY
i. To build the right model to predict the monthly value of imports and exports for
Uganda using time series models.
ii. To choose right time series model to predict the monthly value of imports and
exports.
iii. To highlight the mechanism of the application of the models to predict the monthly
values of imports and exports.
